## Get Started with pseudostate

This is a reproducible example that shows how to use pseudostate.

### Background

The theoretical foundation for pseudo-observations was laid out in a 2003 paper by Andersen, Klein, and Rosthøj:

- Andersen, P. K., Klein, J. P., & Rosthøj, S. (2003). Generalised linear models for correlated pseudo-observations, with applications to multi-state models. *Biometrika*, 90(1), 15–27.

A popular implementation of this technique is the `pseudo` R package, which is available on CRAN:

- [https://cran.r-project.org/package=pseudo](https://cran.r-project.org/package=pseudo)

```{python}

import polars as pl
from pseudostate import calculate_pseudostates

times_and_reals = pl.DataFrame({
		"times": [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
		"reals": [1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1]
})

fixed_time_horizon = 5

calculate_pseudostates(times_and_reals, fixed_time_horizon)

```
