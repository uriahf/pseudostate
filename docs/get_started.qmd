## Get Started with pseudostate

This is a reproducible example that shows how to use pseudostate.

```{python}

import polars as pl
from pseudostate import calculate_pseudostates

times_and_reals = pl.DataFrame({
		"times": [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
		"reals": [1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1]
})

fixed_time_horizon = 3

calculate_pseudostates(times_and_reals, fixed_time_horizon)

```
